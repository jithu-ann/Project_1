Stock Market Analysis 
-Impacts of Social Media (Reddit) and Covid-19

The stock market is a very complicated process of buying, selling and trading company stock. Our team wanted to take a deeper dive into what impacts the stock market, specifically, the internet and real world events. During the year 2020, we witnessed the impacts of the internet as well as a global pandemic across all sectors of industry and government. One particular company and stock that was impacted by these events was Gamestop (GME). 

GME opened in 2020 with a stock price of $6.08. From January 1st, 2020, the stock price of GME saw a number of fluctuations due to the decreasing sales in their retail stores and overall costs to keep these locations running. GME stock continued to decrease through January and Feburary 2020, and the outbreak of Covid-19 began sweeping across the United States and the globe in March. The swift spread and impact of this pandemic continued to negatively impact the stock price of GME. As the year progressed, GME stock had fluctuations into the summer months with no major recovery insight. Many individual investors and day traders began noting that GME stock was being significantly shorted and was much more valuable than the stock price suggested. These individuals began investing in the stock which began to create a positive impact moving towards the end of 2020. In December, earnings reports showed that GME were below their target and necessary changes would be coming to the company. These changes resulted in removal of a number of board members and new board members being added in hopes to turn the company in a more favorable direction.
